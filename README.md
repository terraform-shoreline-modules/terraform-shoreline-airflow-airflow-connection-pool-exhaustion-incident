### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Airflow Connection Pool Exhaustion Incident
---

Apache Airflow connection pool exhaustion incident refers to a situation where the connection pool of Apache Airflow, a popular open-source platform to programmatically create, schedule, and monitor workflows, becomes exhausted and unable to handle additional requests. This can lead to a variety of issues, including slow performance, timeouts, and failures in task execution. The incident can impact the overall productivity and efficiency of the workflows running on the Apache Airflow platform. This type of incident is typically resolved by identifying the root cause of the connection pool exhaustion and implementing measures to optimize connection management, such as increasing the pool size or reducing the connection timeout.

### Parameters
```shell
export PATH_TO_AIRFLOW_CONFIG="PLACEHOLDER"

export DESIRED_POOL_SIZE="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_AIRFLOW_HOME_DIRECTORY="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_AIRFLOW_LOG_FILE="PLACEHOLDER"

export EXPECTED_NUMBER_OF_CONNECTIONS="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### 1. Check the system resource utilization
```shell
top
```

### 2. Check the Apache Airflow process status
```shell
systemctl status airflow-webserver
```

### 3. Check the Apache Airflow logs for any connection pool-related errors
```shell
grep "connection pool" /var/log/airflow/*.log
```

### 4. Check the current number of connections in the pool
```shell
pgrep -f airflow | xargs -I {} sh -c 'echo -n {}" "; ps -eo pid,cmd | grep {} | grep -v grep | awk "{print \$1}" | xargs -I {} sh -c "echo -n ' '; lsof -p {} | grep airflow | grep -c ESTABLISHED"'
```

### 5. Check the Apache Airflow configuration for connection pool settings
```shell
cat ${PATH_TO_AIRFLOW_CONFIG}/airflow.cfg | grep -i connection_pool
```

### 6. Monitor the system and Apache Airflow processes for connection pool exhaustion
```shell
watch -n 1 "pgrep -f airflow | xargs -I {} sh -c 'echo -n {}\" \"; ps -eo pid,cmd | grep {} | grep -v grep | awk \"{print \$1}\" | xargs -I {} sh -c \"echo -n ' '; lsof -p {} | grep airflow | grep -c ESTABLISHED\"'"
```

### High traffic: A sudden surge in user traffic or an increase in the number of workflow tasks can put a strain on the connection pool and lead to exhaustion.
```shell
bash

#!/bin/bash



# Set variables

AIRFLOW_HOME=${PATH_TO_AIRFLOW_HOME_DIRECTORY}

LOG_FILE=${PATH_TO_AIRFLOW_LOG_FILE}

CONNECTIONS=${EXPECTED_NUMBER_OF_CONNECTIONS}



# Get current number of connections

CURRENT_CONNECTIONS=$(psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d airflow -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM connection;" | grep -o '[0-9]*')



# Compare current number of connections with expected number of connections

if [ "$CURRENT_CONNECTIONS" -gt "$CONNECTIONS" ]; then

    # Log message

    echo "$(date) - High traffic causing connection pool exhaustion" >> "$LOG_FILE"



    # Restart Airflow services

    sudo systemctl restart airflow-webserver

    sudo systemctl restart airflow-scheduler

else

    # Log message

    echo "$(date) - Connection pool is healthy" >> "$LOG_FILE"

fi


```

## Repair

### Increase the connection pool size: One of the most common remediation strategies for connection pool exhaustion is to increase the pool size. This can be done by modifying the configuration settings of the Apache Airflow platform to allocate more resources to the connection pool.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Set the path to the Apache Airflow configuration file

CONFIG_FILE=${PATH_TO_AIRFLOW_CONFIG}



# Set the desired pool size

POOL_SIZE=${DESIRED_POOL_SIZE}



# Update the connection pool size in the configuration file

sed -i "s/^parallelism = .*/parallelism = $POOL_SIZE/" $CONFIG_FILE



# Restart Apache Airflow

sudo systemctl restart airflow-webserver

sudo systemctl restart airflow-scheduler


```
